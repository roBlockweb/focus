## How to Use FocusFlow

2. Set how long you want to work (usually 25 minutes)
3. Set how long you want your break to be (usually 5 minutes)
4. Click "Start"
5. Work until the timer beeps, then take a break!

### Step 3: Track Your Goals

It's important to know what you're trying to finish each day. The Goals tab helps you keep track of your tasks.

2. Type a new goal in the box (like "Finish my homework")
3. Click "Add"
4. When you finish a goal, click the checkbox next to it
5. Watch your progress bar fill up as you complete more goals!

### Step 4: See How You're Doing

The Analytics tab shows you charts and information about how you're working. It's like getting a report card for your work habits!
